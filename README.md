It's lonely at the top.

The Techno Union (+10 points to anyone who gets the reference) is a community for freelance/ entrepeneurial/ independent (or just independently minded) tech industry workers in San Francisco.

This isn't a place to pitch "your next big idea" to investors or try to [recruit free labor](http://whartoniteseekscodemonkey-blog.tumblr.com/). 

*The Techno Union is a place to:*
- Find other independent tech workers to have a **Work Session** with.
- Find other independent tech workers to have lunch or coffee with
- Discuss strategies on talking to and negotiating with clients
- Ask other experts questions when Slack Overflow has failed you
- Have open and honest discussions about Tech Working Culture (in all its glory and all its horrors)

## Work Session

Being independent is way better than being a grunt, but locking yourself in your studio can make it difficult to concentrate or not lose your mind.

**Work Sessions** are when multiple tech workers meet up at a common location (like a coffee shop/ co-working space) and sit/ work together. 

The intent of a work session isn't to work on the same project, but rather recreate the camaraderie that you would have with your co-workers.


## Joining
For now, this organization is invite only. Hit me up if you'd like to join.
